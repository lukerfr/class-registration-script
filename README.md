This was my first ever web based monitor/script.

As such, it's quite messy. There are a lot of things that are explicitly defined in the code, no encryption for my user/pass,
and an instance where i just use time.sleep() instead of waiting until a specific site update. 

I may come back to this the next time I need to register for classes, but it was used as more of a proof of concept
and to get me more used to requests than anything else.
